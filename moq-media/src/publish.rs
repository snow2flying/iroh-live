//! Publishing a broadcast: one source, one or more encoded renditions.
//!
//! [`LocalBroadcast`] owns a `moq_net` broadcast producer and the catalog that
//! describes it. Video goes through [`VideoPublisher`], audio through
//! [`AudioPublisher`]; both accept a source and a set of renditions and take
//! care of the rest.
//!
//! The one thing this adds over `moq_video::encode::publish_capture` is
//! simulcast. Upstream, one producer publishes one rendition and owns the
//! device it captures from. A subscriber that adapts to its downlink needs
//! several renditions of the same picture, so [`VideoPublisher`] opens the
//! source once and fans its frames out to an encoder per rendition, each
//! encoding only while someone is watching it.

//! The video publish task: one source, one encoder per rendition.
//!
//! `moq_video::encode::publish_capture` covers the single-rendition case and
//! owns its device. Simulcast cannot reuse it, because every rendition needs
//! the same picture at the same instant and a camera can only be opened once.
//! So the source is read here and its frames are handed to each rendition's
//! encoder through a latest-wins slot: a rendition that falls behind drops
//! frames instead of stalling the ones that have not.
//!
//! Encoders are demand-gated the way upstream gates its device: a rendition
//! encodes only while someone is watching it. The source itself is not, because
//! the local preview draws the same frames the encoders receive and a publisher
//! expects to see itself before anyone has tuned in.

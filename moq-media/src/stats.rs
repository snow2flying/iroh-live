//! The counters a debug overlay draws.
//!
//! An observable value is either a [`Metric`], which keeps a smoothed current
//! reading alongside a ring buffer of samples for a sparkline, or a [`Label`],
//! which is a string. Both are cheap to clone and safe to write from any
//! thread, so a pipeline holds its own handle rather than reaching for a
//! registry.
//!
//! They are grouped by where they come from: [`NetStats`] from the transport,
//! [`EncodeStats`] from the publish path, [`RenderStats`] and [`TimingStats`]
//! from the subscribe path. No string keys and no registration, so a metric
//! that nothing writes is visible as an unused field rather than as an empty
//! row at runtime.

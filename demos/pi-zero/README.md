# pi-zero-demo

Publishes a live camera stream from a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W over iroh, and can
show the connection ticket as a QR code on a Waveshare 2.13" Touch e-Paper HAT.
It also watches a remote stream, rendering with GLES2 either in a window or
straight to HDMI.

The e-paper display is optional. Without the HAT, or with SPI disabled, the
binary still runs and prints the ticket to the terminal.

## Hardware

- **Board**: Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W. A Pi 4 or 5 should work.
- **Camera**: any Pi-compatible CSI camera module.
- **Display** (optional): [Waveshare 2.13inch Touch e-Paper HAT](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/2.13inch_Touch_e-Paper_HAT_Manual),
  revision V4.

## Commands

```sh
./pi-zero-demo publish [--epaper] [--relay <ENDPOINT_ID>] [--name pi-zero]
                       [--width 640] [--height 360] [--fps 30] [--bitrate 500000]
./pi-zero-demo watch <TICKET> [--fb] [--fullscreen]
./pi-zero-demo fb-demo
./pi-zero-demo epaper-demo
```

`publish` runs `rpicam-vid`, publishes the Annex-B H.264 it produces, prints a
ticket, and optionally renders it as a QR code on the HAT. `--relay` also
connects to a relay; publishing is node-wide, so the announce follows the
connection with nothing further to configure.

`watch` subscribes and renders. Without `--fb` it opens a window through glutin
and winit, which needs the `windowed` feature, on by default. With `--fb` it
takes over the console and renders through DRM/KMS, GBM, and EGL directly to
HDMI, with no window system. `--endpoint-id` plus `--name` works in place of a
ticket.

`fb-demo` renders a generated pattern to HDMI with no network and no camera,
which isolates the display path. `epaper-demo` walks the HAT through a
checkerboard, a QR code, and a clear.

## How capture works

On Raspberry Pi OS the CSI camera is only reachable through the libcamera stack:
`/dev/video0` hands back raw Bayer data from the Unicam sensor, unusable without
the ISP. `rpicam-vid` drives that pipeline and the Pi's hardware H.264 encoder,
so this demo reads the Annex-B bytes from its stdout and publishes them
unchanged. The Pi never software-encodes, and the raw YUV pipe (about 10 MB/s at
640x360) never happens.

`moq_mux::codec::h264` splits the stream into access units and derives the
catalog entry from its first SPS, so nothing has to describe an encoding it did
not perform.

`rpicam-vid` has to be on `PATH`. It ships with Raspberry Pi OS.

The V4L2 stateful M2M path that drove the VideoCore codec directly, and the
`codec-test` subcommand that exercised it, were removed with the in-house codec
stack and have no upstream replacement. Watching on the Pi decodes H.264 in
software through openh264.

## Rendering

`src/gles.rs` is a GLES2 renderer over `glow`. The Pi Zero has no Vulkan and no
wgpu, so `moq_video::render` cannot draw there. Two upload routes are chosen from
the decoder's surface: I420 goes up as three `LUMINANCE` textures and is
converted with a BT.601 limited-range fragment shader, which is what openh264
produces, and packed RGBA goes up as a single texture. There is no zero-copy
path.

## Cross-compiling

```sh
cargo make cross-sysroot-aarch64                            # once, from the repo root
cargo make cross-build-aarch64 -- -p pi-zero-demo --release
```

The binary is at `target/aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu/release/pi-zero-demo`. See
[cross/README.md](../../cross/README.md) for prerequisites and the Docker path
for hosts that cannot install zig.

Building on the Pi works too, and is slower:

```sh
sudo apt install build-essential libasound2-dev libpipewire-0.3-dev pkg-config
cargo build -p pi-zero-demo --release
```

The sysroot under `cross/` is assembled from Debian packages, so nothing has to
be copied off a running Pi to build for one.

## Deploying

```sh
scp target/aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu/release/pi-zero-demo pi@<PI_IP>:~/
```

Or `cargo make cross-deploy` from this directory, which builds, strips, and
copies to `$PI_HOST` (default `livepizero`).

## Pi setup

A fresh Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm, 64-bit, with SSH enabled.

### WiFi, before the first boot

`scripts/setup-network.sh` writes a NetworkManager profile onto a Bookworm
rootfs while the SD card is still mounted on the host, which brings the Pi up on
the network without a keyboard or a monitor. It is the one script here that runs
on the development machine rather than on the Pi:

```sh
./scripts/setup-network.sh <SSID> <PSK> [ROOTFS_PATH]
```

`ROOTFS_PATH` defaults to `/var/run/media/$USER/rootfs`.

### Camera

```sh
sudo raspi-config     # Interface Options -> Camera -> Enable
sudo reboot
rpicam-hello --timeout 2000
```

### SPI, for the e-paper HAT

```sh
sudo raspi-config     # Interface Options -> SPI -> Enable
sudo reboot
ls /dev/spidev0.0
```

The HAT plugs onto the 40-pin header with no extra wiring. Align pin 1 and press
it on. The touch controller uses I2C, which this demo does not need.

Active pins:

| Function | BCM GPIO | Board pin |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| SPI MOSI | 10       | 19        |
| SPI SCLK | 11       | 23        |
| SPI CE0  | 8        | 24        |
| DC       | 25       | 22        |
| RST      | 17       | 11        |
| BUSY     | 24       | 18        |

### Permissions

```sh
sudo usermod -aG video,spi,gpio $USER
```

Log out and back in.

`gpu_mem` no longer matters. It sized the VideoCore memory the M2M codec used,
and nothing here opens that codec.

### Camera cable

Plug the CSI ribbon into the small connector near the HDMI port, not the display
connector. Contacts face the board: lift the plastic clip, insert, press back
down.

## Running

```sh
RUST_LOG=info ./pi-zero-demo publish --epaper
```

The ticket is printed to the terminal whether or not the HAT works.

### Persistent secret key

iroh generates a new secret key on first run, so the ticket changes on every
restart unless you pin it. The first run logs the value:

```sh
export IROH_SECRET=abcdef...
./pi-zero-demo publish
```

Any 64 hex characters will do, so a key can also be chosen before the first
run with `openssl rand -hex 32`.

### Starting on boot

[`scripts/pi-zero-demo.service`](scripts/pi-zero-demo.service) is a systemd user
unit that runs the publisher with a pinned secret, keeping the key in a file of
its own rather than in the world-readable unit.
[`scripts/install-service.sh`](scripts/install-service.sh) puts it in place,
from the Pi:

```sh
scp target/aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu/release/pi-zero-demo pi@<PI_HOST>:~/
scp -r demos/pi-zero/scripts pi@<PI_HOST>:~/
ssh pi@<PI_HOST> ./scripts/install-service.sh
```

It refuses to install a binary that is not there or does not run, generates the
secret on first install and keeps it on every one after, enables lingering, and
prints the ticket once the publisher has started. Running it again after
copying a new binary is how the service is updated.

Lingering is the part that is easy to miss: without it the user manager, and so
the publisher, starts at login rather than at boot. Options such as `--epaper`
go in `PI_ZERO_DEMO_ARGS` in `~/.config/pi-zero-demo/env`, which saves editing
the unit. The ticket goes to the journal, where
`journalctl --user -u pi-zero-demo -f` will show it.

## Watching from a desktop

```sh
irl watch <TICKET>
```

Or scan the QR code off the e-paper display.

## Troubleshooting

**No camera.** Check the ribbon cable, run `rpicam-hello`, and confirm the camera
is enabled in `raspi-config`. `rpicam-vid` must be on `PATH`. Running
`v4l2-ctl --list-devices` should list both `unicam` and `bcm2835-codec`; if it
does not, the sensor is not being detected at all and no amount of userspace
configuration will help.

**"could not display QR on e-paper".** SPI is off, the HAT is not connected, or
permissions on `/dev/spidev0.0` or `/dev/gpiochip0` are wrong. The stream keeps
publishing regardless.

**Nothing on HDMI with `--fb`.** Try `fb-demo` first: it removes the network and
the camera from the picture and leaves only DRM/KMS and GLES2.

**The stream stutters or drops.** The Pi Zero's WiFi produces GSO errors
(`sendmsg: Input/output error`) that iroh recovers from on its own, so those log
lines by themselves are not the cause. Pinning a nearby relay usually helps more
than anything else:

```sh
IROH_RELAY=https://euc1-1.relay.n0.iroh-canary.iroh.link./ ./pi-zero-demo publish
```

Turning off WiFi power saving with `sudo iw wlan0 set power_save off` removes
another source of latency spikes.

**SSH is slow to connect.** Set `UseDNS no` in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` on the Pi
and restart sshd, and set `GSSAPIAuthentication no` for the host in your
`~/.ssh/config`.

## E-paper precautions

`epaper.rs` and `epd_v4.rs` are a hand-written driver for the V4 panel
(SSD1680), because `epd-waveshare` covers V2 and V3 only and the V4 refresh
command differs. The code respects every
[Waveshare precaution](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/2.13inch_Touch_e-Paper_HAT_Manual#Precautions):

| # | Precaution | Status |
|---|-----------|--------|
| 1 | No continuous partial refresh without a full one | Full refresh only, never partial |
| 2 | Do not leave powered on when not refreshing | `epd.sleep()` after every update |
| 3 | Minimum 180 s between refreshes, at least one per 24 h | Periodic refresh every 12 h |
| 4 | Re-initialise after sleep before sending data | Every operation creates a fresh `Epd2in13` |
| 5 | Border waveform register | Not applicable: the defaults suit a QR code |
| 6 | Image size must match the display | The buffer is exactly 122x250 |
| 7 | Working voltage and level conversion | Handled by the HAT hardware from V2.1 |
| 8 | The FPC cable is fragile | Physical handling |
| 9 | The screen is fragile | Physical handling |
| 10 | Clear before long-term storage | Cleared to white on Ctrl-C |

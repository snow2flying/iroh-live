//! `irl call`: a 1:1 bidirectional video call.
//!
//! Both peers publish their own side at `calls/<their endpoint id>` and
//! subscribe to the other's, which is all [`Call`] is: [`Live::publish`] and a
//! subscription pointed at each other. Everything here is the window over that,
//! plus the small state machine that decides whether this node is dialing,
//! answering, or already talking.
//!
//! A call is symmetric and so is the way the two sides find each other. Every
//! window shows its own ticket as a QR code while nobody is on the line, and
//! every window has a scan screen that reads one off the camera, so it does not
//! matter which side holds its screen up: whoever scans the other places the
//! call. That is the whole exchange on a machine with no keyboard to paste a
//! ticket into. See [`crate::scan`] for the reader.

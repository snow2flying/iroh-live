//! Turning parsed specifiers into the sources `moq-media` publishes.
//!
//! A capture source is a `moq_video::capture::Config` or a
//! `moq_audio::capture::Config` and nothing more: the device is opened inside
//! the publish task, which is what lets it be released again when publishing
//! stops. The test pattern and the test tone come from
//! [`moq_media::test_source`], so `irl publish --test-source` works on a
//! machine with neither camera nor microphone. Both take the broadcast's own
//! clock, which is what puts the picture's flash and the tone's beep on one
//! timeline for a viewer to judge A/V sync against.
//!
//! The Raspberry Pi camera is the exception: `rpicam-vid` is started here
//! rather than in the publish task. Under `rpicam` what it hands back is
//! already-encoded H.264 and no stage of ours sees a picture; under
//! `rpicam:raw` it hands back I420 and the rest of the pipeline behaves as it
//! would for any other camera.

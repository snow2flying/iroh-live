# iroh-live Android Demo

Two-way video and audio calling on Android. Captures from the device camera with Camera2, encodes with MediaCodec hardware H.264, sends and receives through iroh-live sessions, and renders incoming video with zero-copy EGL `AHardwareBuffer` import.

## Prerequisites

- `ANDROID_HOME` pointing at the Android SDK (e.g. `~/Android/Sdk`)
- Android NDK 28+ (install via Android Studio SDK Manager or `sdkmanager`)
- Rust toolchain with the Android target:
  ```sh
  rustup target add aarch64-linux-android
  ```
- [cargo-ndk](https://github.com/niclas-van-eyk/cargo-ndk-rs) and
  [cargo-make](https://github.com/sagiegurari/cargo-make):
  ```sh
  cargo install cargo-ndk cargo-make
  ```
- JDK 17+ (for Gradle)

## Quick start

From the `demos/android/` directory with a device connected via USB:

```sh
cd demos/android
export ANDROID_HOME=~/Android/Sdk
cargo make install     # builds everything and installs the APK
cargo make logcat      # stream filtered logs in another terminal
```

## Build tasks

All tasks auto-detect the NDK path from `$ANDROID_HOME/ndk/` and pick the highest installed version. See `Makefile.toml` for the full list.

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `cargo make apk` | Full pipeline: cargo-ndk -> clean -> strip -> Gradle APK |
| `cargo make install` | Build + install on connected device |
| `cargo make logcat` | Stream logs filtered to app tags |
| `cargo make logcat-pid` | Stream all logs for the running app PID |
| `cargo make ndk-build` | Build the Rust `.so` only |
| `cargo make clean-jni` | Remove extra `.so` files from jniLibs |
| `cargo make strip` | Strip debug symbols from native lib |

### Manual build (without cargo-make)

```sh
# 1. Build native library (API 26 for AAudio, libc++_shared for C++ runtime)
export ANDROID_NDK_HOME=$ANDROID_HOME/ndk/28.0.12674087  # adjust version
cargo ndk -t arm64-v8a -P 26 --link-libcxx-shared \
  -o demos/android/app/src/main/jniLibs \
  build -p iroh-live-android --release

# 2. Remove extra .so files cargo-ndk copies from dependencies
find demos/android/app/src/main/jniLibs -name "*.so" \
  ! -name "libiroh_live_android.so" ! -name "libc++_shared.so" -delete

# 3. Strip debug symbols (~500 MB -> ~21 MB)
$ANDROID_NDK_HOME/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/bin/llvm-strip \
  demos/android/app/src/main/jniLibs/arm64-v8a/libiroh_live_android.so

# 4. Build APK
cd demos/android
ANDROID_HOME=~/Android/Sdk ./gradlew assembleDebug

# 5. Install
$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools/adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

## Debugging

```sh
export ADB=$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools/adb

# Filtered to relevant tags (Rust tracing, JNI bridge, crashes):
$ADB logcat "iroh_live:V" "IrohBridge:V" "AndroidRuntime:E" "System.err:W" "*:S"

# All logs for the running app process:
$ADB logcat --pid=$($ADB shell pidof -s com.n0.irohlive.demo)

# Clear old logs first:
$ADB logcat -c
```

Key log tags:
- `iroh_live` --Rust-side `tracing` output
- `IrohBridge` --Kotlin JNI bridge
- `AndroidRuntime` --Java/Kotlin crash stack traces

## Feature configuration

Codecs come from `moq-video` and `moq-audio`, which compile every backend they
have on the target and choose one at runtime. On Android that means MediaCodec
for H.264 encode and decode, with openh264 behind it in software.

What the crate does select, in `demos/android/rust/Cargo.toml`:

- `moq-media`: `aec`, which implies `capture` for the microphone and `playback`
  for the speaker. Echo cancellation is not optional on a handset: without it, a
  device on speakerphone publishes its own output back to the peer.

Camera frames come from Kotlin's Camera2 through `pushCameraNv12`, not from a
device `moq_video::capture` opens, so the `capture` feature is here for the
microphone alone.

## Architecture

```
demos/android/
  Makefile.toml  # cargo-make build pipeline
  rust/          # Rust JNI bridge crate (iroh-live-android)
    src/lib.rs   # JNI entry points, camera frame source, session handle
  app/           # Kotlin Android app
    src/main/java/com/n0/irohlive/demo/
      MainActivity.kt   # UI and lifecycle
      IrohBridge.kt     # Kotlin-side JNI declarations
      CameraHelper.kt   # Camera2 camera capture
```

The Kotlin side captures camera frames via Camera2 and pushes them into the Rust layer through JNI. The Rust side uses `moq-media` to encode with Android MediaCodec H.264 and publish through `iroh-live` sessions.

## Requirements

- **minSdk 26** (Android 8.0) --required for AAudio (audio backend)
- **targetSdk 34**, **compileSdk 35**
- arm64-v8a only (x86_64 not currently built)

## Status

Tested end to end on a real Android device, with two-way video and audio between Android and a Linux desktop. See [`docs/platforms.md`](../../docs/platforms.md) for the full support matrix and [`docs/guide/android.md`](../../docs/guide/android.md) for how the pieces fit together.

//! Pull mode: fetch remote broadcasts via iroh-live tickets.
//!
//! When a browser subscribes to a broadcast whose name is a valid
//! [`LiveTicket`], the relay connects to the remote publisher via iroh,
//! subscribes to its broadcast, and mirrors it locally so the browser can
//! consume it transparently.
//!
//! Mirroring goes through the same mechanism a cluster peer connection uses:
//! a MoQ session handed a subscriber [`moq_net::origin::Producer`]
//! auto-ingests whatever the remote side announces into that origin. The
//! subscriber producer here is scoped down to the one broadcast the ticket
//! names (via [`moq_net::origin::Producer::scope`]) and re-rooted to the
//! ticket's local name (via [`moq_net::origin::Producer::with_root`]), so
//! only that broadcast lands in the cluster and nothing else the remote node
//! happens to publish leaks through.
//!
//! Nothing in the cluster owns the pulled QUIC connection, so it has to be
//! retired deliberately, and two signals decide when. Every local session that
//! named the ticket holds a [`PullGuard`], which accounts for a browser that has
//! connected but not subscribed yet. The mirrored broadcast's
//! [`Demand`](moq_net::broadcast::Demand) reports whether anything is reading
//! it, which accounts for a subscriber that reached the broadcast over some
//! other session and holds no guard. Once both have been quiet for
//! [`PullState::with_linger`]'s window the session is dropped, closing the
//! connection, and the ticket's entry is retired so the next pull dials afresh.
//!
//! A transport-level idle timer cannot stand in for either signal. Every counter
//! [`moq_net::Session::stats`] reports is a QUIC counter, and iroh sends
//! keep-alives every five seconds, so a connection nobody is reading moves them
//! exactly like a busy one does.

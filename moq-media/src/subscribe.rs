//! Subscribing to a broadcast: catalog, decode, playout.
//!
//! [`RemoteBroadcast`] watches a broadcast's catalog and hands out a
//! [`VideoTrack`] and an [`AudioTrack`]. Decoding itself is
//! `moq_video::decode::Consumer` and `moq_audio::decode::Consumer`; what this
//! adds is the three things upstream has no counterpart for.
//!
//! The first is rendition selection. `moq_mux::select` is fixed at
//! construction, so a subscriber that wants to follow its downlink has to
//! choose for itself. [`VideoTrack::enable_adaptation`] feeds transport signals
//! through [`crate::adaptive`] and switches renditions when they say so, opening
//! the replacement alongside the incumbent and swapping on its first frame so
//! the picture never goes blank.
//!
//! The second is the playout clock ([`crate::sync`]), which keeps audio and
//! video aligned across two independent decode paths.
//!
//! The third is the catalog extension: chat and publisher identity ride
//! alongside the media sections, and this is where a subscriber reads them.

//! Publish and subscribe plumbing over `moq-video` and `moq-audio`.
//!
//! The media itself is upstream: `moq_video` captures, encodes, decodes, and
//! renders; `moq_audio` does the same for sound and owns the speaker. What
//! lives here is the layer iroh-live needs on top and moq has no counterpart
//! for:
//!
//! - [`publish`] fans one camera out to a simulcast ladder, because an upstream
//!   producer publishes one rendition and owns its device.
//! - [`subscribe`] chooses among those renditions as the downlink moves
//!   ([`adaptive`]), and keeps audio and video aligned across two independent
//!   decode paths ([`sync`], [`playout`]).
//! - [`catalog`] extends hang's catalog with the chat and identity sections
//!   iroh-live publishes.
//! - [`stats`] is the client-side instrumentation a UI draws.
//!
//! Nothing here depends on iroh: a broadcast arrives as a
//! [`moq_net::broadcast::Producer`] or `Consumer`, whatever carried it.

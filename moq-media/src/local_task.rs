//! Running a publish task whose capture stream cannot cross threads.
//!
//! moq's native capture backends are not all `Send`. On Apple platforms a
//! camera or screen stream holds AVFoundation and ScreenCaptureKit objects, so
//! neither the stream nor a future holding it can be handed to a work-stealing
//! executor. The same code compiles on Linux, where those streams are `Send`,
//! which is why this only surfaces when something builds for macOS.
//!
//! [`spawn`] gives such a future a thread of its own and a current-thread
//! runtime to sit in, which is what moq's own documentation asks for. Nothing
//! that touches the device leaves that thread; only the frames it produces do,
//! and those are `Send`.

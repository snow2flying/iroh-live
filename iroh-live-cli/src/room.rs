//! `irl room`: a multi-party room, publishing one broadcast and watching
//! everyone else's.
//!
//! `iroh-rooms` does the discovery: peers announce the names of their
//! broadcasts on a shared gossip topic, and every name that appears comes back
//! as a MoQ subscription. This wraps each of those in a
//! [`RemoteBroadcast`](iroh_live::media::subscribe::RemoteBroadcast), lays them
//! out in a grid, and hands the chat track the room already knows about to the
//! panel at the bottom.
//!
//! Every participant subscribes to every other, so this is a small-group
//! design. There is no selective forwarding.

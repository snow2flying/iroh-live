# Playout and A/V sync

Audio and video decode independently, on separate tasks, from separate tracks.
Something has to keep them together at playout time, and no moq crate has one.
`moq_media::sync::Sync` is that clock, ported from the moq/js player
(`js/watch/src/sync.ts` at commit `53fe78d8`) with the same data model and the
same arithmetic in `i64` milliseconds.

## The algorithm

The clock keeps one number, the *reference*: the earliest
`wall_now - frame_pts` it has ever seen. It only ever moves earlier. Every frame
that arrives faster than any previous one tightens it, and nothing loosens it.

A frame with timestamp `T` is due at wall time `reference + T + latency`, where
`latency` is `max(audio, video) + jitter`. `jitter` is the network allowance,
comes from `PlaybackPolicy::jitter` and defaults to 100 ms, `audio` is how much
sound is queued at the speaker, and `video` is a decode latency a caller may
set.

`Sync::received(pts)` updates the reference, and `Sync::wait_async(pts)` sleeps
until the frame is due, returning `false` if the clock closed underneath it.
`Sync::delay(pts)` exposes the same arithmetic as a `Delay` value for a caller
driving its own timer.

## Who calls what

Video calls both halves. `subscribe::video::deliver` records the arrival with
`received`, awaits `wait_async`, and only then hands the frame to the renderer.

Audio never calls either. It writes decoded frames straight to its
`moq_audio::playback::Sink` and lets the sink's own buffer absorb jitter. What it
does contribute is `Sync::set_audio_buffered(Some(sink.buffered()))` on every
frame. How much sound is still queued ahead of the speaker is the one latency
either side can actually measure, and video holds frames back by it. Without that
coupling a video frame renders as soon as it decodes while its audio is still
behind 50 ms of queued sound.

Beyond that one number the paths never signal each other. They converge because
they share a reference and a latency target, which is the property that made the
JS design worth porting after three earlier attempts at cross-path gating did
worse than no synchronization at all.

`Sync` is per-`RemoteBroadcast`, reachable through `RemoteBroadcast::sync()` for
retuning the jitter figure at runtime, and set from `PlaybackPolicy::jitter`
both when the broadcast is subscribed and on every later
`set_playback_policy`. Dropping the last handle, or calling `shutdown()` on the
broadcast, closes it and wakes everything waiting.

## Playback policy

`PlaybackPolicy` carries the knobs a caller turns.

`sync: SyncMode` chooses between `Synced` and `Unmanaged`. `Synced` is the
default and runs the clock as described. `Unmanaged` skips it entirely: frames go
to the renderer as they decode, with no pacing at all. That suits a test or a
single-track playback where the renderer sets the cadence, and it is not what you
want for live playback with audio.

`jitter: Duration` is the network allowance in the arithmetic above, and is the
largest delay a subscriber adds on its own. It is also the one field of this
policy that takes effect immediately rather than on the next decoder built,
because the clock it configures belongs to the broadcast and outlives any one
track. `irl watch --latency` is the CLI over it; `plans/v2/latency.md` measures
where the rest of the pipeline's delay goes.

`max_latency: Duration` becomes `latency_max` on `moq_video::decode::Config` and
`moq_audio::decode::Config`, which is where upstream decides how much buffered
media to tolerate before skipping forward to the live edge. The default is
150 ms. Raise it when continuity through congestion matters more than returning
to the live edge quickly; lower it when a stall should be skipped over rather
than played out.

`decoder: decode::Kind` becomes `kind` on `moq_video::decode::Config`, which is
where upstream chooses a backend. `Auto` tries the platform's hardware decoders
in turn and falls back to software. A named backend is the only one tried, so a
machine without it fails to open rather than falling back, which is what makes
the choice useful for telling a driver problem from a stream problem.
`gpu_frames` is the last of them: it asks the decoder to leave each picture on
the GPU, which is worth doing for a renderer and not for a consumer that reads
the pixels.

```rust
PlaybackPolicy::default()                     // Synced, 100 ms jitter, 150 ms, Auto
    .with_jitter(Duration::from_millis(400))
    .with_max_latency(Duration::from_millis(600))
    .with_decoder(decode::Kind::Software)
```

`RemoteBroadcast::set_playback_policy` applies `jitter` at once and affects
tracks opened afterwards for everything else. A
decoder reads the policy when it is built and never looks at it again, so a
track already decoding keeps what it started with. `VideoTrack::reopen_decoder`
is how a UI applies a change to a running track: the supervisor opens the
current rendition again, and the replacement takes over on its first frame the
same way a rendition switch does, so the picture stays up across it.

## Reading the timing metrics

`moq_media::stats::TimingStats` defines the timing panel the egui overlay draws.
`audio_buf_ms` is the sink's fill level, `video_lag_ms` and `audio_lag_ms` are
wall-clock drift from each path's PTS cadence, and `av_delta_ms` is
`video_lag - audio_lag`, positive when video trails audio.

Nothing in this repository writes those four today. `LagTracker` exists and is
unused, and the audio and video decode paths record only `render.fps`. The
overlay draws whatever it finds, so the timing panel reads zero until something
fills it in. See [developer tools](devtools.md).

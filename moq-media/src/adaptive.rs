//! Adaptive rendition switching for video tracks.
//!
//! The selection algorithm ([`evaluate`]), the ranking ([`rank_renditions`])
//! and the upgrade bet ([`Probe`]) are used by
//! [`VideoTrack::enable_adaptation`](crate::subscribe::VideoTrack::enable_adaptation)
//! to decide when to switch renditions based on [`NetworkSignals`].
//!
//! Almost nothing QUIC reports describes the direction a subscriber cares about.
//! Loss, congestion events and the congestion window all cover what this
//! endpoint sends, and a subscriber sends little but acknowledgements. The two
//! figures that reach across are the bytes that arrived and the round trip, and
//! the rules here are built out of those two wherever a decision has to hold on
//! a link that is only saturated one way.
//!
//! Both of those are read against a baseline rather than in absolute terms, so
//! both describe change rather than level: what this rendition was delivering a
//! moment ago, and what the round trip was with nothing queued in front of it.
//! A subscriber that joins a link already at its limit measures that limit as
//! the normal state and holds where it started, which is as far as either
//! figure goes. Tightening the limit from there is visible, and so is lifting
//! it, which is what [`Decision::StartProbe`] is for.
//!
//! All of that is the fallback. A publisher on a MoQ version with PROBE sends
//! its own estimate of what the path to this subscriber carries, and that
//! figure ([`NetworkSignals::delivery_bps`]) is the one thing here that
//! describes capacity rather than change: it needs no baseline, so a subscriber
//! that joins a link already at its limit reads the limit, and a limit that
//! lasts keeps reading as one. Where it is present, a rendition is kept while
//! the estimate covers its bitrate and left when it does not, and the rung
//! above is taken when the estimate covers that too, with no probe.

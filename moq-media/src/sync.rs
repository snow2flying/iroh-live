//! The shared playout clock that keeps audio and video aligned.
//!
//! Ported from `moq/js` at commit `53fe78d8`, `js/watch/src/sync.ts`, and the
//! arithmetic is kept identical to the JS source: milliseconds as `i64`, so
//! there is no rounding to reason about when comparing the two.
//!
//! Neither `moq-video` nor `moq-audio` has a counterpart, which is why this is
//! here. Two independent decode paths would otherwise drift apart, because
//! nothing else knows what the other one is holding.
//!
//! ## The model
//!
//! - **`reference`** is the earliest `wall_now - frame_pts` ever seen. It only
//!   ever moves earlier: a frame that arrives faster than every previous one
//!   tightens it, and nothing loosens it. That is what makes it an estimate of
//!   wall time at media time zero rather than a running average.
//! - **`jitter`** is the network jitter allowance, 100 ms by default.
//! - **`audio`** is how much audio is queued at the speaker, reported by the
//!   audio path on every decoded frame (see [`Sync::set_audio_buffered`]).
//! - **`video`** is the video path's own decode latency, if a caller sets one.
//! - **`latency`** is `max(audio, video) + jitter`.
//!
//! A frame stamped `T` is due at `reference + T + latency`.
//!
//! ## How the two paths use it
//!
//! The video path calls [`Sync::received`] as each frame is decoded and
//! [`Sync::wait_async`] before handing it to the renderer. Only video moves the
//! reference; audio is paced by its own device.
//!
//! The audio path reports its buffer depth, which is the only latency either
//! side can actually measure, and video holds frames back by it. That coupling
//! is the whole point: without it a video frame renders as soon as it is
//! decoded while its audio is still queued behind 50 ms of sound.

//! Raspberry Pi camera capture through `rpicam-vid`.
//!
//! On Raspberry Pi OS the CSI camera is only reachable through the libcamera
//! stack: `/dev/video0` hands back raw Bayer data from the Unicam sensor, which
//! is unusable without the ISP. `rpicam-vid` drives that pipeline, so this
//! module runs it as a subprocess and reads whatever it writes to stdout.
//!
//! It writes one of two things, and [`Output`] picks which:
//!
//! - [`Output::H264`] is the Annex-B stream the Pi's hardware encoder produced.
//!   It is the cheapest thing a Pi Zero can publish, because it avoids both the
//!   raw-YUV pipe (about 10 MB/s at 640x360) and a second encode. It arrives as
//!   a [`VideoSource::AnnexB`]; `moq_mux` splits the stream and derives the
//!   catalog rendition from its first SPS.
//! - [`Output::I420`] is raw pictures, which arrive as a
//!   [`VideoSource::Frames`] of [`Surface::I420`]. It costs the pipe and an
//!   encode, and it is the only way anything that needs pixels can see this
//!   camera: a preview, a QR scanner, a software encode, or a simulcast ladder
//!   that has to produce the same picture at several sizes.
//!
//! [`open`] takes a [`Config`] and covers both. A caller that wants the raw
//! pictures on a clock of its own calls [`frames`] instead, which takes a
//! [`RawConfig`]: a geometry that has been rounded to one libcamera leaves
//! tightly packed, which the raw split depends on and which no other type can
//! promise.
//!
//! Shelling out to a camera app is an application concern rather than a
//! `moq-video` one, which is why this lives here.

# Run zigbuild inside Docker. Builds the Docker image on first use.
#
# This is the zero-setup cross-compilation path: no zig, no sysroot, no
# host packages needed. Just Docker.
#
# Usage:
#   ./cross/docker-zigbuild.sh -p iroh-live-cli --release
#   ./cross/docker-zigbuild.sh -p pi-zero-demo --release
#
# The Docker image includes zig, cargo-zigbuild, and a pre-built aarch64
# sysroot, so the first build takes a few minutes while the image is
# constructed.
